## Features

Organize files by type: Files are moved into subfolders based on their extension.

Handles multiple file types: Categorizes files into types like Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Code, etc.

Automatically creates subfolders: Subfolders are automatically created if they donâ€™t exist.

Handles unknown file types: Files that don't match any specified type are moved to the "Others" folder.


## Requirements

Python 3.x

os and shutil modules (both are part of Python's standard library, so no installation is needed).
