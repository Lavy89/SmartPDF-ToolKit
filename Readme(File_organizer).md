# File Organizer


This Python project helps you organize files in a specified folder based on their file types. The script scans the folder and sorts files into subfolders such as Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Code, and Others. Files are moved according to their extensions.

## Features

Organize files by type: Files are moved into subfolders based on their extension.

Handles multiple file types: Categorizes files into types like Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Code, etc.

Automatically creates subfolders: Subfolders are automatically created if they donâ€™t exist.

Handles unknown file types: Files that don't match any specified type are moved to the "Others" folder.


## Requirements

Python 3.x

os and shutil modules (both are part of Python's standard library, so no installation is needed).

 ```git clone https://github.com/Lavy89/SmartPDF-ToolKit.git```
